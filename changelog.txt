				client: represents a user to submit a survey form
				survey: the sury users fill out and admins manage
					surey steps: subsections of surveys that contain survey questions.
						survey questions: individual questions
						survey question groups: survey questions designed as a group
							NOTE: the example survey from the email displays a table to the user which inspired this design. Candidate for optimization
						Note: questions and question groups have an order property indicating their render position
						Note: questions and question groups have notes (read only labels) and anser example texts (likely as placeholds when rendered)
						Note: the example survey has several questions that would be better designed as radios/checkboxes/selects
	add .api
